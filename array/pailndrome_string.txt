Last Updated : 25 Jul, 2021
Given a string, write a c function to check if it is palindrome or not. 
A string is said to be palindrome if reverse of the string is same as string. For example, “abba” is palindrome, but “abbc” is not palindrome.

Recommended: Please solve it on “PRACTICE ” first, before moving on to the solution. 
 
Algorithm: 
isPalindrome(str) 
1) Find length of str. Let length be n. 
2) Initialize low and high indexes as 0 and n-1 respectively. 
3) Do following while low index ‘l’ is smaller than high index ‘h’. 
…..a) If str[l] is not same as str[h], then return false. 
…..b) Increment l and decrement h, i.e., do l++ and h–. 
4) If we reach here, it means we didn’t find a mis
Following is C implementation to check if a given string is palindrome or not.
